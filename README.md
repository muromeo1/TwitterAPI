# TwitterAPI

**This isn't the official API!**

It's only a simple api made on ROR to understand how the architecture REST works.

What's inside:

* CRUD made with scaffold

* Doesn't have any authentication or validation token 

To use:

* Use Postman to make requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

          or

* Clone my "Twitter_consumidor" repository and use simultaneously with the API. More information here:
